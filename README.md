# 2-Cars
I think we can store here some notes and ideas.

Phrases:
 - road: one car's two lanes (so initially there will be two roads)
 
Idea:
 - The need of more players could be solved the following way: there would be a setting, where the player can set the number of roads (each has a dedicated button to control the car on it) this way one can switch hardness of the game with increasing or decreasing the number of the roads, and the same time more player can join to the game with controlling some button (roads). So example two can play on four road with each controlling two cars. (One computer multiplayer)
